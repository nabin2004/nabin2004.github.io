Growing up in a remote part of Nepal, I was motivated by two transformative forces: electricity, which brought computers to my school, and the internet, which linked the world. This reinforces my opinion that AI is the new electricityâ€”it may take time, but it will alter every industry.

I'm Nabin Oli, a BSc (Hons) Data Science student from [Sunway College Kathmandu](https://sunway.edu.np/) with an outstanding academic record. I work on the [Wiseyak](https://wiseyak.com/) AI Team and have helped [Center for AI Research Nepal](https://cair-nepal.org/) preserve [Nepal's cultural heritage through the use of knowledge graphs](https://cair-nepal.org/research/projects/heritagegraph-illuminating-cultural-legacies-throu). I am the [Operations Coordinator](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/pie-ai-kathmandu_datascience-artificialintelligence-operations-activity-7266288171229847552-wABV?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop) at [Pie and AI Kathmandu](https://www.linkedin.com/company/pie-ai-kathmandu/), as well as the Moderator of the Data Fellowship Program at the [SSRC](https://sunway.edu.np/event/applauding-the-data-fellowship-award-winners-champions-of-innovation/). 


I play chess for fun.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
