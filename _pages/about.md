[language isn’t just a tool for communication](). It’s how we interrogate our own thoughts. It's how we challenge what we know, to reach what we don’t know yet. That’s what makes [NLP more than just a subfield of AI](). It’s a path to building machines that can [reason](), [reflect](), and maybe even [rethink]().

[AI is the new electricity.]()  I may not become the [Edison]() of this revolution, but I intend to be part of this new-age electricity at the very least.

Resources? I’ve never had many. But neither did the Wright brothers, and they still flew before nations did. My ambition is to build [billion-parameter-scale models]() before I finish my undergrad. [Not because it's easy or funded but because it's possible.]()

I play chess for fun. -->



<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
