**ChessXAI** is a project dedicated to building an **Explainable Chess AI** that not only plays chess at a high level but also provides insights into its decision-making process. By combining the strategic depth of chess with the transparency of explainable AI, this project aims to demystify AI's thought process, making it accessible and understandable for players of all skill levels.
